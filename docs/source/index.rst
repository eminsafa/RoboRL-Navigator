Documentation of RoboRL Navigator
=================================

**RoboRL Navigator** is a project that offers a codebase for Reinforcement Learning tailored to manipulator robots, particularly the Franka Emika Panda Robot. The project includes both Bullet and ROS Gazebo simulation environments that can be used to train the model to reach a specified pose. It also utilizes an open-source Grasping Pose Detection project that can be tested in either the Gazebo Simulation environment or the Real World.

Explore the :doc:`usage` section for more details, including instructions on :ref:`installation` of the project.
