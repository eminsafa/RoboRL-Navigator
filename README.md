RoboRL Navigator is a project that provides Reinforcement Learning codebase for 
manipulator robots, especially Franka Emika Panda Robot initialized.
It has Bullet and ROS Gazebo simulation environments to train the model
to reach given position. It also uses an open-source Grasping Pose Detection project
that can be tested on Gazebo Simulation or Real World.

RoboRL Navigator, already sim-to-real adjustment. Thus, trained models can be tested on
real world.
